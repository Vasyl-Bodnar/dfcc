# dfcc
C23 C compiler that aims to be fast to compile and easy to develop backends for.

Heavy work in progress. Only lexer is more or less done at the moment.

# Build
In root directory run:

```
build.scm
```

This should produce the executable and artifacts in the `build` folder.

# Run
Currently only supports compilation of a single file:

```sh
dfcc FILE
```

# Licensing
This project and its files are licensed under MPL-2.0.
